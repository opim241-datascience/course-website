# TL;DR

You will form groups of a maximum of 3 students and your task is to perform analysis and modeling on a provided dataset to answer a specific business question. The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis (i.e., not calculating every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable) but rather show that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis and models, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results.

While the project is somewhat open ended, there are some requirements you need to meet:

* You must create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data in R.
There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use, but sticking to packages we learned in class (`tidyverse`) is required.
* You must build a model that helps answer the business question.
* You do not need to visualize all of the data at once.
* A single high quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations.
* Pay attention to your presentation.
* Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count.
* All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R.

# The Scenario

You just started a new job as a data scientist at travel company that specializes in providing cultural and educational trips. Examples of organized trips include history and science trips for middle- and high-school students, exchange trips for university students. The company provides superb service and takes care of all the numerous details needed to support a large group of young people traveling. 

Most of the trips are of the "teacher organized, parent paid" type. Teachers usually started having meetings about the trips with company representatives to go over details, etc. The company has collected and tracked data about the organizer and the travel group.

Your supervisor has just asked the team of data scientists (including you) to help prepare for an upcoming strategy meeting. Travel contract renewals are coming up and your task is to predict which customers will book a trip next year. This will help drive the marketing strategy and take action to keep (retain) customers.

You will be provided with data files that, among other things, has historical data about trips and organizations. These datasets, along with further directions and a data dictionary will be provided in the repository. 

# Deliverables

* Presentation
* Executive summary
* Repository with code files

## Presentation

* 5 minutes maximum, and each team member should say something substantial.
You will record submit your video when the project is due.
* Prepare a slide deck using the template in your repo. This template uses a package called `xaringan`, and allows you to make presentation slides using R Markdown syntax. There isn't a limit to how many slides you can use, just a time limit (5 minutes total).
* Each team member should get a chance to speak during the presentation.
* Your presentation should not just be an account of everything you tried ("then we did this, then we did this, etc."), instead it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you found.

Before you finalize your presentation, make sure your chunks are turned off with `echo = FALSE`.

## Executive summary

* Along with your presentation slides, we want you to provide a brief summary of your project in the README of your repository.
* This executive summary should provide information about the goal, your research question(s), your methodology, and your findings and results.
* The executive summary will be evaluated based on whether it follows guidance and whether it's concise but detailed enough.

## Repository organization

* You will be provided with a project repository template with the source data files. This will be in the form of a group repository instead of an individual repository in GitHub. 
* This repository will contain all of your analysis code, the presentation, and the executive summary.

# Grading Scheme

The project will be graded holistically and will assess the following aspects:

* Analysis and code, and your implementation in R
* Presentation
* Executive summary
* Reproducibility and organization
* Team peer evaluation

## A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:

-   90%-100% - Outstanding effort. Students understand how to apply all concepts and techniques to answer the questions, can put the results into a cogent argument, can implement code, and can clearly communicate the results to others.
-   80%-89% - Good effort. Students understand most of the concepts, put together an adequate argument, identify some weaknesses of their argument, and communicate most results clearly to others.
-   70%-79% - Passing effort. Students have misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, have some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.
-   60%-69% - Struggling effort. Students are making some effort, but have misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.
-   Below 60% - Students are not making a sufficient effort.


### Team peer evaluation

* You will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the contribution of each team member.
* You will additionally report a contribution percentage for each team member.
* This is not optional. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than 20% of the work, please provide some explanation.
* If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that they did less than 10% of the work, this person will receive half the grade of the rest of the group.

### Late work policy

-   There is no late submission. All project work will be due during finals period on Thursday, May 13 2021.

# Tips

-   You're working in the same repo as your teammates now, so merge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that's fine Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.

-   Review the requirements and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.

-   Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).

-   Set aside time to work together and apart (physically).

-   When you're done, review the documents on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work.
    Then go get some rest!

-   Code: In your presentation your code should be hidden (`echo = FALSE`) so that your document is neat and easy to read.
    However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your R Markdown file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.

    -   Exception: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you're welcomed to show that portion.

-   Teamwork: You are to complete the assignment as a team.
    All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized.
    While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.
